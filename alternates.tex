\cite{lee14} also spends some time discussing \textbf{conjugate gradient descent} (CG) and its recent variant, \textbf{multigrid conjugate gradient descent}, although it ultimately finds that the V-Cycle algorithm performs much better than either of these alternatives. Brief (and informal) explanations of these methods are given here.
