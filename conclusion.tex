Although image matting is not perfect in practice, and some effort is often required to produce an adequate sketch, it is clearly a very powerful and widely applicable technique. On top of that, it's relatively straightforward to explain mathematically, and takes much less effort to implement than many similar image processing algorithms (although its implementation is by no means trivial).

Although \cite{lee14} is a recent paper, it is by no means the cutting edge of matting research. None of the methods here described date later than $2011$, and most of the mathematics dates back to the mid to late 20th century. However, the techniques described here have not lost their power in the intervening years, and a quick look around is all it takes to see how abundant they are in the forefront of image and video processing research.
