Image matting is an extensive field, but in this paper I focus on foreground and background extraction. Given an image $I$, we wish to produce a matte, $\alpha_{i}\in[0,1]$, such that at each pixel $i$ we can deconstruct the color value $I_{i}$ into a sum of samples from a foreground color $F_{i}$ and a background color $B_{i}$. To produce the color value in our original image, we then take
\[I_{i}=\alpha_{i}F_{i}+(1-\alpha_{i})B_{i}\]
