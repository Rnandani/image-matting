When dealing with image matting, we can construct a graph such that each pixel is a vertex and adjacent pixels share an edge. Such a graph is naturally undirected and non-looping. However, the bulk of image matting is determining appropriate weights for the edges, so we cannot immediately construct a Graph Laplacian. Instead, we use a variant of the Graph Laplacian called the \textbf{Matting Laplacian} \cite{levin08}. Although identical in construction, our $D$ and $A$ must be produced through a different vertex \textbf{affinity function} than simple adjacency. The choice of this affinity function is open, but we use the form shown in \cite{levin08}, which is outlined in \textbf{Techniques}.
