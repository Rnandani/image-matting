When dealing with image matting, we can construct a graph such that each pixel is a vertex and adjacent pixels share an edge. Such a graph is naturally undirected and non-looping. However, the bulk of image matting is determining appropriate weights for the edges, so we cannot immediately construct a Graph Laplacian.
