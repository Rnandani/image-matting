\textbf{Multigrid conjugate gradient descent} is based on the idea that we can converge more efficiently by taking into account the residuals of downscaled version of our system of linear equations. As with our previous use of multigrid methods, the goal is to remove low frequency components of our error at about the same pace as high frequency components. Since the corrections steps found at lower resolutions of our problem do more to address the low frequency error, we can take our correction step at each iteration to be a linear combination of the correction steps from each resolution of our problem. This algorithm is explored in detail in \cite{pflaum08}
