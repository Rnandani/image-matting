\textbf{Multigrid conjugate gradient descent} is based on the idea that we can converge more efficiently by taking into account the residuals of downscaled versions of our system of linear equations. As with our previous use of multigrid methods, the goal is to remove low frequency components of our error at about the same pace as high frequency components. Since the correction steps found at lower resolutions of our problem do more to address the low frequency error, we can take our correction step at each iteration to be a linear combination of the correction steps from each resolution of our problem. This algorithm is explored in detail in \cite{pflaum08}.

Although \cite{lee14} finds this method to be much closer in performance to V-Cycle than standard CG, it still takes more iterations in general. As such, the conclusion of \cite{lee14} is that V-Cycle is still the best option for solving the large systems of linear equations necessary in image matting.
