In images taken of moving scenes, objects that move a visible distance during the image exposure have visible blur along the direction in which they move. In \cite{dai08}, this blur is both removed, and analyzed to determine how objects in a single picture were moving when the picture was taken. The key innovation of \cite{dai08} is to begin analyzing motion blur by matting the image for alpha (exactly as described in this paper) in order to determine how much a given object has blurred into each pixel. See \cite{dai08} for further details, as matting is unrelated to deblurring beyond this initial step.
